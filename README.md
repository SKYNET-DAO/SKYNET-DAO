# SKYNET Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

SKYNET DAO is an American non-profit company. It was established in January 2022. Since its launch, SKYNET has experienced a complete community-independent development process for more than 3 years, proving that 100% decentralization has no better advantages. The establishment of SKYNET DAO aims to provide better guidance for the development of SKYNET ecology, and try to promote the integration of SKYNET ecology into traditional society to help people protect Internet privacy and human rights. SKYNET DAO is primarily funded through grants and dues from for-profit companies, mines, and individuals that rely on SKYNET's ecological technology.The DAO was established in early 2022, when the DAO led by a16z began to become popular in the cryptocurrency field, and referred to the decentralized project governance ideas proposed by a16z.

Here SKYNET DAO isn't the SKYNET DAO LLC.
